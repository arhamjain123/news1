        <p>Too much bad cholesterol could play a havoc with your overall health and make you susceptible to multiple chronic diseases. Excess cholesterol gets accumulated as plaque on your artery walls putting you at risk of heart attack and many other chronic diseases like stroke, diabetes and high blood pressure. Once you find out that you have a high cholesterol through lipid profile, you should immediately introduce sustainable lifestyle changes that could aid in cutting cholesterol and help you in leading a healthy life. Cholesterol, however, isn't your enemy and HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is actually good for your health as it helps remove bad cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoprotein) from your body.
