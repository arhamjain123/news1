        <p>As the Madhya Pradesh government has bagged a project of a dedicated manufacturing zone for power and renewable energy equipment, Maharashtra former minister and Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) leader Aaditya Thackeray said the project was proposed by the Maha Vikas Aghadi in June this year. Maharashtra's economic isolation seems like sanctions have been imposed on the state, Aaditya Thackeray said on the loss of the 5th project after Vedanta-Foxconn, Medical drug park, bulk drugs park and Tata-Airbus.
