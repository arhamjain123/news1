And this time, she can be seen enacting Alia's famous 'pathological liar' sequence from the actor's Filmfare interview</p>
        <p>"I am a Born Pathological liar," read the caption posted along with the video. The text overlay on the video reads, "Please recreate Alia Bhatt's 'Abke Baras' story." This video shows Chandni re-enacting a particular segment from Alia Bhatt's 2019 Filmfare interview with Jitesh Pillaai.
