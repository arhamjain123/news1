        <p>Actor Govinda could not have found a better match for himself than wife Sunita Ahuja and this latest clip from Indian Idol is proof. On an upcoming special episode of Indian Idol, Govinda will be joined by Dharmendra on the show while Sunita also tags along. Govinda's son Yashvardhan will also be seen on television for the first time. (Also read: Govinda dances with wife Sunita for first time, kisses her on Indian Idol 13)

        <p>In a new promo, as Yashvardhan makes his entry on stage, host Aditya Narayan reminds everyone how last time, Sunita and Govinda had said that while she was pregnant with Yash, Govinda kept a picture of Dharmendra in front of her, hoping for a son just as handsome as him. Sunita had a wild new suggestion.
