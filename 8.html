        <p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is on the month-long ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ during a media interaction held in Akola, Maharashtra, said, “Whichever corrupt leaders who take up offers for ₹10 crores, 50 crores and run to the BJP, are in turn washing away the stench of corruption in the Congress.”

        <p>His remarks come after 26 Congress leaders from Himachal eloped to the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) during the recently held state elections.</p>
        <p>Responding to a reporter’s question on why Congress leaders are leaving the party for the BJP, he said, “A Shiv Sena MLA was walking with me who said he was offered ₹50 crores to leave his party for the BJP. He didn’t take the offer, while many others did. So in this way, the Opposition is getting clean with these corrupt leaders leaving. It’s a good thing, and there is no shortage of honest people in India who will join Congress.”</p>
        <p>On November 8, 26 Congress leaders in Himachal Pradesh, including former Congress general secretary Dharampal Thakur, Youth Congress president Rahul Negi, former councillor Rajan Thakur, and former district vice president Amit Mehta jumped the boat to the BJP.
